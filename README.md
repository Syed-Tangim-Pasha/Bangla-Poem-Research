# Bangla-Poem-Research

This was my B.Sc. thesis. I worked on Bangla poem research which is part of Bangla Natural Language Processing. I also worked on making for the first time Bangla poem dataset. I Collected 2207 poems with 11 different categories. After collecting and making the dataset I was working on Bangla poem classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches. As, Bangla poem classification using Machine Learning approaches already had been done before by Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, so in this research, I improved accuracy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and also proposed some other Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB). In this research, for the first time, I proposed Deep Learning models like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to classify Bangla poem.
